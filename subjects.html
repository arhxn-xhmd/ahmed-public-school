                    <p><b><i>"Subjects are the building blocks of knowledge, each one a window to understanding the world and shaping the future."</i></b> At Ahmed Public School, every subject plays a vital role in nurturing curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking.</p>
                    <p><b><i>In the early years of education at Ahmed Public School, the focus is on building a strong foundation through a blend of core and creative subjects.</i></b> For Nursery and KG, the curriculum includes <b><i>basic literacy, numeracy, environmental awareness, art, music, and physical activities,</i></b> which help develop cognitive, motor, and social skills. From 1st to 5th grade, students are introduced to <b><i>Mathematics, English, Science, Social Studies, and Languages,</i></b> along with <b><i>Art, Music, and Physical Education.</i></b> These subjects are designed to foster curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking, ensuring holistic development during these formative years.</p>
                    <p><b><i>In middle and secondary school, the curriculum becomes more structured and diverse.</i></b> From 6th to 8th grade, students study core subjects like <b><i>Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, and English,</i></b> along with additional languages such as <b><i>Hindi, French, Urdu, Spanish, German or Sanskrit.</i></b> They also explore <b><i>Computer Science, Art, Music, and Physical Education.</i></b> In 9th and 10th grade, the focus shifts to preparing for board exams, with subjects like <b><i>Mathematics, Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology), Social Science, English, and a second language.</i></b> These years emphasize conceptual understanding, analytical skills, and application-based learning, preparing students for higher academic challenges.</p>
                    <p><b><i>In senior secondary school, students choose specialized streams based on their interests and career goals.</i></b> The three main streams are <b><i>Science (with options for Physics, Chemistry, Biology, or Mathematics), Commerce (with subjects like Accountancy, Business Studies, and Economics), and Humanities (including History, Political Science, Psychology, and Geography).</i></b> Additionally, students continue with <b><i>English and optional subjects like Computer Science or Physical Education.</i></b> These subjects are crucial for building a strong academic foundation, developing critical thinking, and preparing students for competitive exams and future careers. The focus is on in-depth knowledge, practical application, and skill development to ensure success in higher education and beyond.</p>
